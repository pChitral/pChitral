Hello, my name is [Chitral Patil](https://chitralpatil.propael.com/) and I am Entrepreneurial AI/ML Software Engineer with a foundation in computer engineering, currently pursuing master's in Data Science at [SUNY Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/). Co-founder of [Propael](propael.com), a game-changing job application tool, with a rich background in Silicon Valley startups and large-scale data pipeline architecture.

In the heart of Silicon Valley's dynamic startup ecosystem, I've carved a niche for myself as a forward-thinking Data Scientist and Entrepreneur. My journey began during my undergraduate studies in computer engineering, where I picked elective subjects that revolved around data science like Machine Learning, NLP, Artificial Intelligence & Soft Computing, Big Data & Analytics, and Data Warehousing & Mining. Motivated by these experiences, I am now pursuing a master's degree in data science from the University at Buffalo.

My journey is a blend of deep technical expertise and sharp business acumen, making me adept at both coding and understanding the nuances of the market. At CYQIQ, an early-stage startup, I wore multiple hats - from an AI/ML Software Engineer to diving deep into entrepreneurial realms. I honed skills beyond coding, delving into customer discovery, market sizing, and direct interactions with clients. This holistic experience has been instrumental in shaping my vision and approach.

My passion project, [Propael](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cover-letter-generator-by/dgjpjeefobehjaccmpgldamhfeangmhm?hl=en-US), stands as a testament to my commitment to innovation. As a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cover-letter-generator-by/dgjpjeefobehjaccmpgldamhfeangmhm?hl=en-US), Propael is revolutionizing job applications by offering one-click automation for ATS-friendly cover letters, providing exclusive insights like pinpointing the exact years of experience required for a job, and delivering tailored content through our unique RAG Architecture. We're not just another tool; we're a game-changer, recognized with the blue tick on the Google Chrome Webstore and proudly holding the Established Publisher Badge. With over 100 daily active users, we're making a tangible difference in the job application process.

Parallelly, as a Graduate Research Assistant, I've been instrumental in architecting data pipelines for a staggering 2.5 TB of data. My focus on fraud detection isn't just about data crunching; it's about optimizing storage and ensuring the integrity of the information we handle.

In essence, I'm not just a technologist; I'm a problem solver, an innovator, and a visionary entrepreneur. Always eager to connect with fellow trailblazers and disruptors. Let's shape the future together!
