Hello, my name is Chitral Patil and I am a master's student at [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw27mhBhC9ARIsAIFsETES3S4ElhtbdaDPDWNoGpreg4foIBAxgeRi3DQwqXA6xniSS0mBIJ8aAtwsEALw_wcB/) majoring in Data Science. A creative and inquisitive mind with a passion for music and data science, I have been honing my skills over the past sixteen years. My journey began as a five-year-old child, training in Hindustani Classical Music, developing an innate longing to recognize patterns and visualize them. This passion for pattern recognition carried on into my undergraduate studies in computer engineering, where I picked elective subjects that revolved around data science like Machine Learning, NLP, Artificial Intelligence & Soft Computing, Big Data & Analytics and Data Warehousing & Mining. Motivated by these experiences, I am now pursuing a master's degree in data science from University at Buffalo. 

From internships to part-time roles, I have made substantial contributions to companies such as IRCTC and Computer Society of India. As Student Convener & Mentor, I effectively managed a team of 60 members and doubled membership in just three months. As Chairperson, I oversaw the organization‚Äôs growth of student membership from 75 members to 250 in the span of 6 months. As Content Creator, I displayed creative ability to design society's activities posters and flyers, resulting in a 10% increase in enrollment.

Combining my guitar specialization from Berklee College of Music with my growing expertise in data science, I have become a leader with impressive problem solving abilities, strategic planning capabilities, and excellent communication skills. I am excited to continue this journey and use my knowledge and experience to make meaningful contributions towards the world of data science.
